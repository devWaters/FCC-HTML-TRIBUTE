        <p> Kentaro Miura-san's impact on the industry can not be understated, everywhere you look you can find something inspired by berserk. Characters like Artorias from Dark Souls or Caim from the Drakengard series, shows like Fullmetal Alchemist, Demon Slayer, would not exist had berserk not been around. At the time of release for a series to touch on dark subjects was nothing new, Miura-san himself being heavily inspired by the works of Go Nagai-san, specifically Violence Jack, but the raw visceral nature of Berserk isn't tied to the gore and violence, it tugs at the emotion within us and brings forth a disturbing level empathy towards the characters. We are able to see ourselves, in all facets, in these characters, and in that way it pulls us into the world, and feel it's weight.
          <br><br>
Following Kentaro Miura-san's death the anime and manga spaces, and quite frankly, the world at large, deeply mourned his passing. Berserk continues to be authored under the studio he created, Studio Gaga. Helmed by Kouji Mori-san, Miura-san's long time friend and fellow mangaka, Berserk and Studio Gaga have continued to preserve Miura-san's legacy, style, and spirit. 
           <br><br>
Kentaro Miura-san is but another in a long line of people that have suffered in the manga industry, it's harsh deadlines, cutting editors, and absurdly competitive nature witling down person after person. 
<br>
Let Kentaro Miura-san's sacrifice to be a staunch reminder that art is to be enjoyed, it is to be made for the love of it and the life it brings, not squeezed out from a person, wrung and sivved from their mind until they are to be thrown away.
